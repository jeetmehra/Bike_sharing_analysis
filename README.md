## Recommendation
25% increase in price from 2021 to 2022 resulted in increase in demand by 64%. So a conversative increase in price could not only help in increasing the demand but it can also help to avoid the price ceiling avoiding the drop in demand. An increase in the range of 10%-15% could help in testing the market without resulting in the loss of customers.
